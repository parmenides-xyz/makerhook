# Test-Driven Development Implementation

## Overview

The SphericalMath and SphericalTickMath libraries were completely reimplemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Process

1. Write tests first
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor and optimize
4. Repeat for each function

## Benefits

- Fewer bugs during implementation
- Better test coverage
- More maintainable code
- Correct implementation of mathematical formulas

## Test Coverage

- 42 unit tests for SphericalTickMath
- 30+ unit tests for SphericalMath
- Comprehensive Echidna property-based tests
- Edge case coverage for Q96 arithmetic
